Abstract: 
In our project, we will be helping the entrepreneurs by recommending them the best place to establish their businesses by providing predominant details like:
1. Are there any competitors in that area? if so how is their business running?
2. Using the reviews their competitors had received we can provide key insights regarding the areas they need to concentrate more on their business to overcome their peers.
3. Using the data we had we can predict the price for new apartments by giving some new specifications.
4. Specifications for the building like Area of the building, parking space, etc.
5. Providing details about the surrounding locality, for example, a person who is willing to establish a Food court wants his business    in a fully crowded locality, where many IT company’s, colleges, etc.. might be residing.
6. What are the parameters affecting price hikes?
7. How much distance is my Apartment from the restaurant?

Similarly, we can help out the people who are relocating to Bangalore, consider you are moving to Bangalore city for the first time. you might not be aware of Bangalore and didn’t have any connections there so it will be very difficult for you to settle there. So to tackle this problem we shall use Machine Learning Algorithms alongside Foursquare API to get the details of various apartments in Bangalore along with their precise Latitudes and Longitudes(available Below). Now for choosing for the best apartment, you need to consider the following facts:
1. How much distance is my office from the Apartment?
2. Are there any Restaurants Available nearby to Apartment?.
3. Are there any cafe’s nearby?
4. What are the parameters affecting price hikes?
5. Are they “ready to move”?, If not when can I move to the Apartment?
6. what are the square feet of the apartment?
7. At what distance can I find a badminton court from my apartment?
